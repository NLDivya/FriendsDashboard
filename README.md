### FRIENDS Dashboard
Creating a Interactive Dashboard using Tableau. In this project, I have analysed Friends series Dataset.

###### Data:
The dataset and reference is taken from YouTube. It consists of a csv file.
The file consists of 9 fields and 236 rows. The fields are :
Episode title, Description, Season, Episode, Duration in minutes, year, Director, Total Stars and Total Votes.


###### Approach:
* Connecting the data to data source. In my case, the data is in the form of csv file.
* Create worksheets to design the required visualization like year, Season, Total number of votes, stars, description etc.
* Create a new dashboard and add all the relevant worksheets and perform all the necessary filtering options.
